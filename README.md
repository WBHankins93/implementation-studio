## 🎯 What is This?

Implementation Studio teaches deployment scenarios with **real constraints** that enterprise and defense customers actually have:
- Air-gapped networks
- Private clusters
- Firewall restrictions
- Multi-tenant isolation

Unlike tutorials that teach tools in isolation, this platform focuses on the **customer implementation lifecycle** - getting software deployed and operational in constrained environments.

**Primary Audiences:**
- Solutions Engineers implementing software in customer environments
- Platform Engineers supporting customer-facing deployments
- DevOps Engineers learning "last mile" deployment patterns
- Engineers preparing for SE roles

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone and explore:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WBHankins93/implementation-studio.git
   cd implementation-studio
   ```

2. **Read the getting started guide:**
   - [Getting Started Guide](./docs/getting-started.md) - Prerequisites, installation, first steps
   - [Learning Paths](./docs/learning-paths.md) - Recommended progression

3. **Choose your first lab:**
   - **Lab 01** (Standard GKE) - If you have GCP access → [View Lab 01](./labs/01-standard-deployment/README.md)
   - **Lab 02** (Air-Gapped) - Fully local, no cloud costs → [View Lab 02](./labs/02-airgapped-deployment/README.md)

4. **Follow the lab README** - Each lab has comprehensive documentation
